## Analysis

## Design
[[ note that BLOCK_COUNT, ITERATIONS, and BLOCK_SIZE should only be defined in
main.c.  they should not be defined in allocator.[ch]. (once you grok, you can
delete this comment.) ]]

## Plateau Schedule

## Empirical Investigation

[[ each of my programs prints out
  @@ block_count ... iterations ... block size ..., 
and then let's /usr/bin/time print
  max resident memory ..., times: user ... elapse ..., context switches ....
see the Makefile for the command line options I used with /usr/bin/time .
